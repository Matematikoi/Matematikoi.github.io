I am starting my PhD on "Large-scale query plan representation with data
augmentation and query optimization", in the [[https://team.inria.fr/cedar/][CEDAR]] team, under the
supervision of [[https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~yanlei.diao/][Yanlei Diao]] and
[[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_QpalLwAAAAJ&hl=en][Guillaume Lachaud]]. I will be working in the [[https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/][Ecole Polytechnique Informatics Team]]
in Paris.

I am very excited of this new chapter in my life after completing my Masters
degree in Big Data Management and Analytics.
