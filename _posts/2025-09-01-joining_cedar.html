<p>
I am starting my PhD on &ldquo;Large-scale query plan representation with data
augmentation and query optimization&rdquo;, in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/cedar/">CEDAR</a> team, under the
supervision of <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~yanlei.diao/">Yanlei Diao</a> and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_QpalLwAAAAJ&hl=en">Guillaume Lachaud</a>. I will be working in the <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/">Ecole Polytechnique Informatics Team</a>
in Paris.
</p>

<p>
I am very excited of this new chapter in my life after completing my Masters
degree in Big Data Management and Analytics.
